# cowin

Used this script to book my covid vaccination slot through cowin site when the vaccination slots were opened.  
It was nearly impossible to book slots manually that time.  
Script will check if any slots are available for certain pincodes.  
Once slots open, it will open Chrome browser and enter the mobile number and request for OTP.  
Once OTP is received it will automatically read it from the messages chat DB on Mac and enter same to the browser(Mac and iPhone message sync necessary).  
Also, an alert sound is played to notify.
